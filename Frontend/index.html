        <p class="quoteme">After a period of service in the U.S. Army as a cryptographic linguist, I moved into the world of clinical health care and spent the last eight years working with multi-disciplinary health care teams around the country to provide the best possible health outcomes for our patients, particularly during the Covid-19 crisis. While I enjoyed the work and the service to my patients, the challenges of that field and the desire for a better work/life balance finally collided with the urging of several friends in tech to lead me to what I should have been doing all along. Having been a life-long tech enthusiast and “the guy that knows about computers,” I am seeking to put my knowledge and experiences toward helping teams create great products and user experiences as I continue to learn and grow. </p>
